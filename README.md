# Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories Database

Forked from [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Solumin/YGO-FM-FusionCalc) original author [Solumin](https://github.com/Solumin).
Due to Inactive maintenance, I decided to added some style, and make it look more great, also made some changes in the actual code...
